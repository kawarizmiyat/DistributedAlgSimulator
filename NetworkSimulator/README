This project constitute the basic of a network simulator. 
The important classes are: 

1. SimSystem: This is where the simulator run and setup. 
2. FututeEvent: There is a variable future in class SimSystem 
in which events are entered in a FIFO manner. 
3. ExchangeNode: 
	- This is where the protocol must be implemented. 
	- Each of such object has a set of states and a set of message types

4. Message: the sender, receiver, msgType and msgContent. 
	- could be extended later. 


// TODO:
Note that every ExchangeNode uses an object of SimSystem in order to access 
the object future (for future events). We can make SimSystem and future 
as static objects. 


// TODO: broadcast algorithm - with a single initiator.
